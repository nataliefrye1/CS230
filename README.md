The Gaming Room wanted to develop a web based game that served multiple platforms. Some of the software requirements were to have the ability of one or more teams involved, multiple players, and the ability to create unique team name. They wanted their game to bring new opportunities for increased accessibility and player engagement across multiple devices. In developing my documentation, I did particularly well in explaining design constrains an evaluating the different development requirements. This allowed the client to have  a full understanding of the options available to them. It was helpful to create different graphs and list out key points in the design document in order to develop code. If I were to choose one part of my work to revise it would be the recommendations and making sure to go into as much detail as possible. I interpreted the user’s needs and implemented them int o my design by creating different categories of focus to make sure all bases were covered. It’s important to consider the user’s needs when designing so that they can reach their end goal. I approached designing software in a very systematic and organized way. Some techniques I would use in the future to analyze a similar software application is the continue use of graphs and charts that make it easy for the client to understand.
